        "This service enables clinics, pharmacies, and medical warehouses to apply for a register of controlled and semi-controlled drugs custody. You can apply through the MoHAP website or smart app using UAE PASS.  You'll need to fill out an application form, which will be reviewed by the Drug Department. If approved, you'll pay the associated fees online, and the register will be sent to you via courier. Your healthcare facility must have a valid license.",
        "To renew the registration, you must be a Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) company registered with MOHAP and a medical warehouse with a valid license. You'll need to submit an online application and pay the fees. The registration officer will review the application and may request additional documents.  The renewed registration is valid for five years from the last expiry date.",
        "You can appeal a decision by submitting an appeal to the Office of the Minister of Health and Prevention within 15 days of receiving the decision. The appeal is then reviewed by the Grievance Committee, and you will receive a response after their review."
